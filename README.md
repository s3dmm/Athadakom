This repository contains a prototype Python-style script for the main menu of the 2D trivia game **اتحداكم**.

`MainMenu.py` demonstrates how the UI could be created using Python for Unity or pseudo logic. The main menu includes:

- A title displaying "اتحداكم" at the top of the screen
- Play, Profile, and Settings buttons
- Placeholder background
- Logic for the Play button to load a scene named `Level1`

The script is meant for prototyping and can be ported to C# within Unity.
